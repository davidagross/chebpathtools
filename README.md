chebpathtools
=============

these functions help me deal with multiple chebfun [1] distributions as well as grabbing the nightly build.

usage
-----

My current use case for this code is simply putting changeChebfuVersion in my startup.m function.  
This way, when MATLAB opens, I can choose which distribution I use (any of those currently on my machine
or grab the nightly build).

extensible
----------

...is something that this code currently isn't.  Any additions to make this code more useful to a 
wider audience would be greatly appreciated.
